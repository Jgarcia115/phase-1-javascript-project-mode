# Drink Looker

Drink Looker is an application that helps users find fun, good looking drinks.

## Description

By using [this api](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php?ref=apilist.fun) to access lists of cocktails, Drink Looker provides pictures and names for different cocktail ideas. Each drink also allows for comments from users.

## Support

For questions or issues my email is : jon.garcia.015@gmail.com

## Roadmap

As an MVP, the possibility of incorporating more drinks and cocktails is definitly next in line. Having star rating review in addition to the comment sections could add a lot more clear distinction between drinks.

## Acknowledgment
